This readme file created as description for the code repository of #Direct and Indirect Genetic Effects of Parental Susceptibility to Mental Health Conditions and Related Traits on Children’s Behavioural Difficulties: A Multi-Cohort Study#
We analysed data from eight European birth cohorts, including more than 33,000 parent–child trios. For each cohort, we generated 18 polygenic scores (PGSs) related to mental health, neurodevelopmental conditions, educational attainment (EA), and substance use for children (PGSc), mothers (PGSm), and fathers (PGSf). These scores were used to predict child externalising, internalising, and overall behavioural difficulties, reported by parents during both preschool and school-age periods. Cohort-specific results were then synthesised using both univariate and multivariate meta-analysis approaches.
