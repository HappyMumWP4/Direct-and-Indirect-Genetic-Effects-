# Direct and Indirect Genetic Effects of Parental Susceptibility to Mental Health Conditions and Related Traits on Children’s Behavioural Difficulties: A Multi-Cohort Study

This repository contains the analysis scripts used in the study **“Direct and Indirect Genetic Effects of Parental Susceptibility to Mental Health Conditions and Related Traits on Children’s Behavioural Difficulties: A Multi-Cohort Study.”**

## 📘 Study Overview
We analysed data from **eight European birth cohorts**, comprising **over 33,000 parent–child trios**.  
For each cohort, we generated **18 polygenic scores (PGSs)** related to:
- Mental health conditions  
- Neurodevelopmental conditions  
- Educational attainment (EA)  
- Substance use  

PGSs were computed for:
- **Children (PGS<sub>c</sub>)**
- **Mothers (PGS<sub>m</sub>)**
- **Fathers (PGS<sub>f</sub>)**

These PGSs were used to predict **child behavioural difficulties** (externalising, internalising, and total problem scores), reported by parents during **preschool** and **school-age** periods.

Cohort-level results were synthesised using both:
- **Univariate meta-analysis**, and  
- **Multivariate meta-analysis** approaches.
